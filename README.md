# Counting-Pi
Throwing a bunch of points at a dartboard and counting them to find pi

A pretty interesting demonstration of calculating pi is generating a random point in a square containing a circle, and then checking if that point is inside the circle.
If it is, add 1 to the circle's tally and 1 to the total tally
The ratio of the circle's points and total points * 4 approaches Pi
